## Hand Gesture Recognition  

Gesture recognition has been a very interesting problem in `Computer Vision` community for a long time. This is particularly due to the fact that segmentation of foreground object from a cluttered background is a challenging problem in real-time. The most obvious reason is because of the semantic gap involved when a human looks at an image and a computer looking at the same image. Humans can easily figure out what‚Äôs in an image but for a computer, images are just 3-dimensional matrices. It is because of this, computer vision problems remains a challenge.

## About the project

Gesture recognition is an active research field in Human-Computer Interaction technology. It has many applications in virtual environment control and sign language translation, robot control, or music creation. In this machine learning project on Hand Gesture Recognition, we are going to make a real-time Hand Gesture Recognizer using the `MediaPipe` framework and `Tensorflow` in `OpenCV` and Python.
OpenCV is a real-time Computer vision and image-processing framework built on C/C++. But we‚Äôll use it on python via the OpenCV-python package.This is a `python-based` application that recognizes hand gestures like okay, peace, thumbs up, thumbs down, call me, stop, rock, live long, fist and smile and also provide a fun game to play by the side, a Snake Game based Hand Gesture and movements We have developed this project using `OpenCV` and `Keras modules` of python.
